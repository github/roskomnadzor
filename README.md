#### What is this?
From time to time, GitHub receives requests from the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media ([Roskomnadzor](http://eng.rkn.gov.ru/)) to censor certain content that has been declared unlawful in the Russian Federation. Although we may not always agree with the choices the Russian government has made, to ensure that our many Russian users continue to have access to GitHub to collaborate and build software, we may need to block content if we receive a valid request from Roskomnadzor. Whenever we do so, we will post the official request that led to the block in this repository. 

#### Why is this?
We are concerned about Internet censorship, and believe that transparency is a virtue. By posting the notices here, we can better inform the public about what content is being withheld from GitHub, and why. We post takedown notices here to document their potential to chill speech.

#### What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?
It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date.  It does *not* mean that the takedown was unlawful or wrong. It does *not* mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We post the notices only for informational purposes. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. You can draw your own conclusions.
